                            Volunteer Avenue was founded in [2024] by a group of dedicated volunteers who recognized the need for a centralized platform to streamline the process of finding and joining volunteer opportunities. Over the years, we have grown into a vibrant community of volunteers and organizations working together to address pressing social issues and contribute to the well-being of society.
