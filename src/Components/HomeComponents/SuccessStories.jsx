                        Emma joined Volunteer Avenue two years ago, eager to make a difference in her community. She started volunteering at a local homeless shelter, where she helped prepare meals and provided support to those in need. Through her dedication, Emma built strong relationships with the shelter s residents, offering them not just food, but hope and a sense of belonging.
